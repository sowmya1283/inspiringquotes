# Handmade Hobbies

## I. Site Overview

A website to showcase and sell handmade craft projects for selling or even blogging or to combine both. As you know handicrafts is the manual labour and they are very small-scale medium to generate products rather than using automated machines. A phenomenon known as the “handmade effect” occurs when buyers show a preference for these goods over the ones that are largely produced.

A person’s values and personality are best expressed through handmade products, which always have a large value in the market. They showcase the benefits of “uniqueness” and "love. “This website is designed for any fellow hobbyists, or any customers who are interested to buy or even learn. If someone who share the same passion and love for handmade craft items then this website is for perfect for you. Colourful crochet items, small mirror or mosaic art and also quilling art are added in this website.

Wireframes were added to this project to keep my thoughts structured and to avoid any discrepancies from the actual website design. Links to the five targeted pages on desktop and mobile platforms are provided below.

**_Mobile Wireframes:_**

[Sign-Up Page](https://github.com/sowmya1283/handmadehobbies/blob/main/docs/wireframes/Signuppage_desktop.png)

In order to improve the user experience, wireframes were modified a changed a bit. Please find the below changes.

Though some texts were added to the Crazy For Crochet, Mosaic Art and Quilling Craft pages initially, they have been removed and might be added in upcoming deployments.
Initial ‘Header’ had the same design across all the pages. Later only logo has been added in the home page and rest of the pages have same title.
Header section of the welcome page has new logo. (Old logo has been replaced)

### Colour Scheme:

When making my selection, I wanted to go with a color palette that was stylish. For this reason, I went with a light blue navigation bar and accent colors of dim light orange and grey. To gauge the contrast scores, I developed a colour grid using the colour https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/ . I was able to guarantee that all text stayed visible and that everyone could visit the website by using this grid.


![Color grid used](https://github.com/sowmya1283/handmadehobbies/blob/main/docs/screenshots/%20colorgrid.png)

## III. Current Features Common to all pages

### Header Element

The header element stays fixed at the top of the page when the user first scrolls through (or scrolls up and down). A Code Institute alumnus pointed out that the sticky header will improve user experience and adhere to prevailing trends. The header itself contains the below elements.

**_Title:_**

![Title Screenshot](https://github.com/sowmya1283/handmadehobbies/blob/main/docs/screenshots/title.png)

- The title serves to state the name of the Website.
- The title is present in Crazy For Crochet, Mosaic Art, Quilling Craft and Sign Up pages.
- The title is not present in the ‘Welcome Home’ Page. Logo with the text same as Handmade Hobbies is presented to the user to appease.
- Title in all other pages also serves as a navigation link to the home page “Welcome Home!” as per the well-established convention expected by the user.

**_Logo:_**

- The logos are created to the captivate user’s attention and to portray the website intentions. Colourful ai generated image of heart is presented in ‘Welcome Home!’ page. (The other pages have Title with the same text as mentioned in the logo of the home page.)

- Logo on mobile devices ensured the title stays as big as possible on a smaller screen, improving the user experience.

![Hover over highlight](https://github.com/sowmya1283/handmadehobbies/blob/main/docs/screenshots/HoveroverNavbar.png)

### Hero Image

- I have included a hero image in the ‘Welcome Home!’ page only.
- All other pages are similar to gallery pages and have nav links.
- And also a sign-up form also doesn’t have any logo image.
- Hero image screenshot can be found in the Home page section further in the document.

### Footer

- The footer includes direct links to all the social media platform with the little icons
- Initially social media platforms were having the placeholder texts then later replaced with icons. These icons are very small and take-up very little space.
- Still Handmade Hobbies accounts on all those Social Media platform is pending to be developed in the upcoming phases. These links then will updated to connect to the respective pages.
- These icons were imported from font awesome using Javascript at the bottom of the page.
- A statement stating that all photographs on the website are the property of Handmade Hobbies and that the site is only meant for educational reasons was included. I added this after chatting on Slack with the Code Institute for suggestions.

![Footer](https://github.com/sowmya1283/handmadehobbies/blob/main/docs/screenshots/footer.png)

### Typography

Throughout the page, there are three fonts used:

- Merienda- as the website intended to be creative. It has a font-family of Dancing style making the heading attractive.
- Default fall back font-family has been given as sans-serif.
- For all other headings including the navbar default font is used.
- All fonts were sourced from Google fonts, as stated in the credits.

## IV. Individual Page Content features

### Home Page Or ‘Welcome Home!’ Page:

**_Hero-Image:_**

Very striking and colourful hero image for a website that displays a range of artistic crafts. A variety of colourful supplies and equipment, including yarn, coloured pencils, beads, fabric and paintbrushes are used in the scenario. There’s a hand-drawn sign in the foreground that says “Handmaade Hobbies.” As you can see, the image has two ‘AA’’s in the ‘HANDMAADE’ just to be more creative.
The background image is configured to cover with the position centre, thus the image appears fantastic on all screen resolution.


![Hero Image](https://github.com/sowmya1283/handmadehobbies/blob/main/docs/screenshots/hero.png)


Inside the hero image, an overlay with the craft categories are listed in this web site. This is added because to create an customer attention or to make a positive impact to a new visitor on the website. This text is made readable with a transparent background making it easier to notice. The position of this overlay is made absolute so that it can be placed on top of the Hero image.

**_What? , Why? and Benefits! Section:_**

The main purpose of the website is to inspire, convey information or benefits of handmade craft items , connect with like-minded hobbyists , to reach out to the author for any collaborative work and etc. Therefore the section below the hero image is divided into three parts with detail information about ‘What is’ handmade hobbies is all about? ‘Why’ Handmade hobbies? and ‘Benefits’ of Handmade hobbies for any individual.

As you can see the images below, they are having a title information as mentioned above.

![What are handmade hobbies](https://github.com/sowmya1283/handmadehobbies/blob/main/docs/screenshots/what.png)

![Why handmade hobbies](https://github.com/sowmya1283/handmadehobbies/blob/main/docs/screenshots/why.png)

![Benefits of handmade hobbies](https://github.com/sowmya1283/handmadehobbies/blob/main/docs/screenshots/benefits.png)

The above section is also made responsive based on the Mobile, Tablet and Laptop version. Enough padding is added to make the content displayed neatly within the div for larger screens. Whereas padding has been reduced to make sure that this content is more readable on mobile devices.

**_Circular image:_**

Circular image has been added to match the handmade hobbies content which is mentioned above and is responsive according to the screen resolution.

The circular image conveys the message that what users will be doing when they see handmade hobbies. The image has seven sections where people are involved in crochet, knitting, moulding clay, painting etc.

![Added circular screenshot](https://github.com/sowmya1283/handmadehobbies/blob/main/docs/screenshots/circularimage.png)

**_Meetup Times:_**

The last section of our welcome home page is our ‘Meetup times’ section. A website’s “Meetup” section can greatly increase consumer interaction, offer social and educational benefits, and also will help to create a solid, dedicated client base. It may provide lively and engaging environment for their clients by providing a range of activities and making sure that communication is simple.

This section provides visitors about all the necessary information about our timings of meetup events happening over the complete week. Based on the information provided on the website user can decide which meetup session they want to join.
this meetup events tell information like time, day of the meetup and what will be the agenda of the meetup.

## All the other page contents(Similar to Gallery)

All the pages apart from welcome home page in the website are similar like ‘Gallery’ pages. They have different images files loaded and are responsive to the screen sizes. On mobile screens, these images are loaded in single column. As the screen size increases the column are spread-out. To help the visually impaired users on the scenario of failed image loading, an alt text has been added to each image. In-case of image loading fails, the alt text displays. Columns will increase according to the screen size. (eg., for mobile single column, for tablet 3 columns and laptops four columns)

## V. Future-Enhancements

- The future intention of the site would be to serve as a website specifically to grow visitors and involve more hobbyists to sign up to the website. To add more content related to new designs, tutorials, different type of materials used. If possible enhance the website to create a buy and sell platform at later stages.
- At first, the purpose would remain to inspire people and spread awareness about benefits of hand-crafted items. However, There would be additional content as mentioned above.
